        Simple Omelette Recipe An easy and quick dish, perfect for any meal.
        This classic omelette combines beaten eggs cooked to perfection,
        optionally filled with your choice of cheese, vegetables, or meats.
        Preparation time Total: Approximately 10 minutes Preparation: 5 minutes
        Cooking: 5 minutes Ingredients 2-3 large eggs Salt, to taste Pepper, to
        taste 1 tablespoon of butter or oil Optional fillings: cheese, diced
        vegetables, cooked meats, herbs Instructions Beat the eggs: In a bowl,
        beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed.
        You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture. Heat
        the pan: Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or
        oil. Cook the omelette: Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in
        the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure the eggs evenly coat the surface. Add
        fillings (optional): When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are
        still slightly runny in the middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over
        one half of the omelette. Fold and serve: As the omelette continues to
        cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the fillings. Let it cook
        for another minute, then slide it onto a plate. Enjoy: Serve hot, with
        additional salt and pepper if needed. Nutrition The table below shows
        nutritional values per serving without the additional fillings. Calories
